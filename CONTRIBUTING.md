## How to contribute to the Emoji Two library

### SVG code format
* Try to maintain the general code convention currently found in the library.

### Bugs
* Check the [current issues](https://github.com/Crissov/emojitwo/issues/) to be sure the bug hasn't already been reported.
* If you've written a patch for the bug submit a [pull request](https://github.com/Crissov/emojitwo/pulls) including your patch.
* Include a brief description of the issue and how your patch will solve it.

### Emoji art (PNG & SVG)
* Unlike [Emojione](https://github.com/Ranks/emojione-assets/), Emojitwo very much welcomes additions and changes to the artwork. This is covered by the original and unrevokable [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license chosen for Emojione 2.x artwork by Ranks.com.
* Design suggestions are welcome. They will be considered by the community. There's no guarantee they will be adopted. 
* Notes on visual errors are also very much accepted.
* Both can be submitted as issues or pull requests at Github. Pull requests *must* contain the edited SVGs and *may* contain the respective PNGs generated from that.
* Do not backport designs from Emojione 3+ or other sets with more restrictive or unknown licenses!
* We intend to provide graphics for all new emojis from upcoming releases of the [Unicode Standard](http://unicode.org/alloc/Pipeline.html) (i.e. codepoints) and of [Unicode Emoji](http://unicode.org/reports/tr51/proposed.html) (sequences). Contributions welcome!
* We actively support the addition of graphics for new sequences even if they are not supported by any other vendor.
  
Thank you for your interest in contributing to this library.
