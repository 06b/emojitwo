Version 2.x of Emojione is no longer supported by [Ranks.com](https://emojione.com). 
Some people prefer the flat cartoon design and the FOSS license with actual access to the SVG sources.

# EmojiTwo 

The artwork of the second generation of the web's first complete open source emoji set. It is and will stay 100% free.

## Differences between Emojitwo and Emojione 2.x

* Emojitwo is restricted to the artwork, i.e. image files.
  SVG is its native format, everything else is derived from that.
* Emojitwo shall eventually include graphics for new emojis:
  - Characters defined in the Unicode Standard 10.0 (June 2017) and later.
  - Sequences documented in Unicode Emoji 5.0 (March 2017) and later (UTS#51), e.g. flags.
  - Characters extended in Unicode Emoji 6.0 and later (UTS#51).
  - Existing Unicode characters without the `Emoji` property.
  - Custom sequences or alternatives.

As of its initial release in April 2017, Emojitwo does not yet contain any additional artwork.
